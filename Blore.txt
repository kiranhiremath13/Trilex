Sub:On behalf of Charleston County Citizens requesting to change the IT Services Contract from TCS to other American Companies

Dear Chairman,

We are writing on behalf of Charleston County Citizens and fellow Americans,

Save Charleston County Citizens Data Prviacy and our tax money, we noticed that from last 15 to 20 years IT Services contract for Charleston County is given to only one Indian Company i.e. Tata Consultancy services formerley known as CMC America, Hopefully you remember that Charleston County filed its lawsuit against Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. in late 2006, alleging breach of contract, fraud and negligent misrepresentation, among other things, as you know county was fooled once and shouldnâ€™t risk future mishaps with Charleston Citizens data.

We heard that Charleston County IT Department Administrators/Directors getting some personal benfits from Tata Consulting Services for favoring them and leaking confidencial information regarding the IT deal bid,they are trying hard to won this bid for Tata Consultancy Services, So Considering all above points we request you to give a fair chances to other US based companies to bid for this opportunity and allow them to serve Charleston County, So that our fellow Americans can get some jobs and earn thier lively hood.


We are addressing same to below Honourable Governer and Senators 

1) copy to Henry McMaster (Governor, SC)

2) Copy to Pamela Evette (Lieutenant Governor, SC)

3) Copy to Lindesey Graham (Senator SC)

4) Copy to Tim Scott (Senator SC)

5) Copy to John J. Tecklenburg (Mayor, Charleston City)

6) Copy to Charleston County Chairmen,Council Members and South Carolina 

We belive in " Buy American;Hire American"

God Bless America and Charleston County Citizens



Your Sincerly

Charleston Area Seniors.
